          <strong>APR Disclosure:</strong> Some lenders may offer loans with an Annual Percentage
          Rate (APR) between 5.99% and 35.99%. The APR is the cost of your loan expressed as a
          yearly rate. The APR and loan terms you are offered depend on your credit score, income,
          debt, loan amount requested, and credit history. Only borrowers with excellent credit will
          qualify for the lowest rates. All loans are subject to credit review and approval.

        <strong>Not a Lender:</strong> {companyName} is not a lender, does not broker loans, and
        does not make credit decisions. {companyName} provides a free service to connect consumers
        with lenders who may offer them loans. We do not guarantee that you will be matched with a
        lender or that you will receive a loan offer, nor do we guarantee the terms of any loan offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Credit Impact:</strong> Checking your rate will not affect your credit score. If
        you are matched with a lender, and you choose to accept a loan offer, the lender will
        conduct a hard credit inquiry which may impact your credit score.

          availability of loans and specific terms depend on your state of residence and applicable
          laws and regulations. Please consult your state's regulations for more information.
