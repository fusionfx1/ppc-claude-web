        >
        Lenders in our network typically offer Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) ranging
        from 5.99% to 35.99%. APR is the total cost of credit, including interest
        and fees, expressed as a yearly rate. Lenders determine APR based on factors
        including credit score, income, and state laws.
