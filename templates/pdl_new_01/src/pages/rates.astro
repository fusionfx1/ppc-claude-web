                        <p>
                            Annual Percentage Rate (APR) reflects the cost of
                            borrowing a loan. It includes the interest rate plus
                            any fees related to the loan. Lenders in our network
                            typically offer APRs ranging from <strong
                                class="text-primary">5.99% to 35.99%</strong
                            > for qualified consumers.

                            Lenders may charge additional fees such as
                            origination fees, late payment fees, or returned
                            check fees. ElasticCredits.com does NOT charge you

                            If you cannot make your payments on time, it could
