## Target Segments Prompt (Copy to Claude Desktop)

```
Based on our Master Strategy Document and Competitive Analysis, help me define detailed Target Customer Segments. For each segment, include:

1. Demographics (company size, revenue, role, location)
2. Psychographics (values, behaviors, motivations)
3. Pain points and challenges
4. Goals and desired outcomes
5. Where to find them (communities, channels, events)
6. Messaging that resonates
7. Objections they'll have
8. Buying process and decision factors

Create 3 segments: Primary (launch focus), Secondary (phase 2), Tertiary (phase 3). Be specific enough that I could identify these people in a room.
