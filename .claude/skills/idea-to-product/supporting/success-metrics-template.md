# Success Metrics & Milestones Template

**Purpose:** Define clear, measurable success criteria for each phase of product development and launch.

## Success Metrics Prompt (Copy to Claude Desktop)

```
Based on our Master Strategy Document and GTM Playbook, help me define Success Metrics and Milestones. Include:

1. Phase-by-phase metrics (Pre-launch, Launch, Growth, Scale)
2. KPIs for each metric (specific numbers)
3. Leading vs lagging indicators
4. How to measure each metric
5. Warning thresholds (when to worry)
6. Stretch goals

Make metrics specific, measurable, and time-bound. Focus on metrics that matter for a bootstrapped SaaS, not vanity metrics.

## Metric Definitions

### How We Calculate

**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):**
```
MRR = Sum of all active subscription monthly values
- Include: Active subscriptions
- Exclude: One-time purchases, refunds pending
```

**Churn Rate:**
```
Monthly Churn = (Customers lost in month / Customers at start) × 100
```

**LTV (Lifetime Value):**
```
LTV = ARPU × Average customer lifetime
LTV = ARPU / Monthly churn rate
```

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):**
```
CAC = Total acquisition spend / New customers acquired
```

**Activation Rate:**
```
Activation = Users who [key action] within [timeframe] / Total signups
Key action: [Define what activation means for your product]
```
