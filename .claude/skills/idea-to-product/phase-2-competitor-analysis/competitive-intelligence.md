## Synthesis Prompt (Copy to Claude Desktop)

```
Based on the [X] competitor briefs I've provided, synthesize the findings into a Competitive Intelligence document. Analyze patterns across competitors, identify market gaps, and provide strategic recommendations.

Structure your analysis as:
1. Market Overview (who's in the space, how it's segmented)
2. Competitive Landscape Map (visual positioning)
3. Feature Comparison Matrix (table of all features)
4. Pricing Analysis (patterns and opportunities)
5. Gap Analysis (what's missing in the market)
6. Differentiation Strategy (how we win)
7. Competitive Advantages to Build
8. Go-to-Market Implications

Be strategic and actionable. I need to make decisions based on this analysis.
