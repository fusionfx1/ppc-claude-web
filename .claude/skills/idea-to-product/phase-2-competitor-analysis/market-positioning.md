Based on our Master Strategy Document and Competitive Intelligence, help me develop a Market Positioning strategy. I need:

1. Positioning statement (for [target], we are [category] that [benefit], unlike [competitors] we [differentiator])
2. Category strategy (create new vs join existing)
3. Key messages for different audiences
4. Competitive battle cards (how to position against each competitor)
5. Brand voice and personality

Make it specific and actionable. I'll use this for marketing copy, sales conversations, and product decisions.
