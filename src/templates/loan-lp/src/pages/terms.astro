      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> {new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Service Description</h2>
      <p>{companyName} operates an online platform that connects consumers seeking personal loans with a network of third-party lenders. We are not a lender and do not make credit decisions or loan offers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Eligibility</h2>
      <p>To use our service, you must be at least 18 years old, a U.S. resident, and have a valid Social Security number. By submitting a request, you represent that the information you provide is accurate and complete.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Not a Loan Offer</h2>
      <p>Nothing on this website constitutes a loan offer. Any loan terms, rates, or amounts displayed are for illustrative purposes only. Actual loan terms are determined by the lender and may vary based on your creditworthiness and other factors.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Third-Party Lenders</h2>
      <p>{companyName} is not responsible for the actions, products, or services of any third-party lender. Once you are connected with a lender, your interaction is governed by that lender's own terms and policies.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Credit Inquiries</h2>
      <p>Checking your rate through our service requires a soft credit inquiry, which does not affect your credit score. If you proceed with a loan application through a lender, the lender may perform a hard credit inquiry which could impact your score.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>This service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that you will receive a loan offer or that any specific terms will be available.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>{companyName} shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of this service.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions about these terms, contact {companyName} at legal@{import.meta.env.SITE_URL ? new URL(import.meta.env.SITE_URL).hostname : 'example.com'}.</p>
