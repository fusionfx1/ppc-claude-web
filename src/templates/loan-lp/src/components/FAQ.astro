    question: 'Will checking my rate affect my credit score?',
    answer: 'No. Checking your rate only requires a soft credit pull, which does not affect your credit score. A hard inquiry only occurs if you accept a loan offer and proceed with the application.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can I borrow?',
    answer: 'Loan amounts typically range from $1,000 to $50,000, depending on your creditworthiness, income, and the lender\'s terms. Use the slider above to select your desired amount.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can I receive funds?',
    answer: 'Many lenders in our network can fund loans as fast as the next business day after approval. Some may take 2–5 business days depending on your bank and the lender.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What credit score do I need?',
    answer: 'Our network includes lenders for all credit profiles. While better credit scores typically receive lower rates, options are available for borrowers with fair or poor credit as well.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this service free?',
    answer: 'Yes, our matching service is completely free. There are no fees to check your rate or see your options. If you accept a loan, the lender will disclose all fees and terms before you commit.',
