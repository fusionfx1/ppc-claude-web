## 🎄 Holiday Release: AI-Friendly Development

This release transforms AstroDeck into a truly AI-native starter kit. We've consolidated our AI configuration into the industry-standard AGENTS.md format, added a dedicated Claude Code Agent, and completely redesigned the homepage to showcase these capabilities.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🤖 AGENTS.md Standard Support

AstroDeck now follows the [AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md) – an open format for guiding AI coding agents, adopted by **60,000+ repositories** and stewarded by the Linux Foundation.

**Supported tools include:**
- OpenAI Codex
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Google Jules
- Gemini CLI
- Windsurf
- VS Code (Copilot Agent)
- Claude Code
- And many more (Zed, Aider, Factory, Amp, RooCode...)

### 🧠 Dedicated Claude Code Agent

A custom sub-agent configuration (`.claude/agents/astrodeck.md`) that:
- Understands the entire AstroDeck project structure
- Provides proactive security, accessibility, and SEO warnings
- Offers intelligent code suggestions following project conventions
- References the AGENTS.md as single source of truth

### 🎨 Redesigned Homepage

- **New AI Feature Section** – Showcases supported tools with official logos via [lobe-icons](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons)
- **Highlighted USPs** – Custom `<mark>` effect for key phrases (subtle green highlight)
- **Updated Hero Copy** – "Ready to take off" messaging with clear value proposition
- **Reordered Sections** – AI Feature section now prominently placed before Features
